If a point \\(x\\) is periodic, then there exist a positive integer \\(n\\) such that \\[A^n x - x \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2, \\mbox{ i.e., } (A^n - I)x  = y \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2.\\]\nSince \\(A\\) has integer entries, the matrix \\(M = A^n - I\\) does too. Furthermore the determinant \\[\\det(M) = \\det(A^n - I) = \\prod_{i=1}^2 (\\lambda_i^n - 1)\\] where \\(\\lambda_i\\) are the eigenvalues of \\(A\\). The eigenvalues of \\(A\\) are real and irrational, thus \\(\\lambda_i^n - 1 \\neq 0\\) for all \\(n\\), so \\(\\det(M) \\neq 0\\).\nSince \\(M\\) is an integer matrix with nonzero determinant, it is invertible over the rationals, so \\(x = M^{-1} y\\) so \\(x\\) is rational.\no\noo\no+o- -o+o- -o+o- -o+o- -o+o- -o+o- -o+o- -o+o- -o+o- -o+o- -o+o- -o+o- -o+o- -o+o- -o+o- -o+o- -o+o- -o+o- -o+o-\noo\no\nConversely, if \\(x\\) is rational, we can factor out the common denominator \\(d\\) to get \\(x = \\frac{1}{d} z\\) for some \\(z \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\). We want to show that there exist a positive integer \\(n\\) such that \\[A^n x - x \\in \\mathbb{Z}^2, \\mbox{ i.e., } A^n x \\equiv x  \\mod 1. \\]\nWe’ll use the pigeonhold principle.\nPigeons: matrices \\(A^{n_i}\\)\nPigeonholes: matrices \\(A^{n_i}\\) modulo \\(d\\)\nEach entry of \\(A^{n_i}\\) modulo \\(d\\) gives \\(d\\) possible values, so there are \\(d^4\\) possible pigeonholes. The entries of \\(A^{n_i}\\) are (increasing) Fibonacci numbers so clearly there are more pigeons than pigeonholes, so by the pigeonhole principle there must be exist a pair of integers \\(n_i\\) and \\(n_j\\) such that \\(A^{n_i} \\equiv A^{n_j} \\mod d\\).\nSince \\(A\\) is invertible, we can multiply both sides by \\(A^{-n_j}\\) to get \\(A^{n_i - n_j} \\equiv I \\mod d\\).\n\n\n\n\nVisualize the cat map using this link to a 3D model"
