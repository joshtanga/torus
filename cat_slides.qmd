# Deformations of a Torus

## Homeomorphisms {.smaller .scrollable}

::: panel-tabset
### Definition
- Topology preserving deformation
- Continuous with continuous inverse
- Bend, stretch, twist but no tearing or joining
- Cutting is ok, as long as you glue it back the same way


### Examples
- The circle is homeomorphic to a knot.  
![7-1-knot](assets/7-1-knot.png){width=20%}
- The torus is homeomorphic to a coffee mug.
- The torus is homeomorphic to a square with opposite edges identified.
![square torus](assets/square-torus.png){width=50%}
- The torus is homeomorphic to a hexagon with opposite edges identified.
![hexagonal torus](assets/hex-torus.png){width=50%}
- The torus is homeomorphic to a *surgered* square with opposite edges

## Isotopies

::: panel-tabset

### Definition
- A continuous deformation through time
- Each step is a homeomorphism

### Examples
- The torus is isotopic to a coffee mug.
- A thin torus is isotopic to a thick torus.
- PhotoBooth/App effects are isotopies of pixel coordinates
- The square torus is not isotopic to the hexagonal torus.
