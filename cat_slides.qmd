# Deformations of a Torus

<!--The Arnold principle: "Discoveries are rarely attributed to the correct person" is also named after him.[1]

see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigler%27s_law_of_eponymy-->


## Homeomorphisms {.smaller .scrollable}

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Definition
- Topology preserving deformation
- Continuous with continuous inverse
- Bend, stretch, twist but no tearing or joining
- Cutting is ok, as long as you glue it back the same way


### Examples
::: {#fig-circle layout-ncol=2}

## Isotopies

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Definition
- A continuous deformation through time
- Each step is a homeomorphism

### Examples
- The torus is isotopic to a coffee mug.
- A thin torus is isotopic to a thick torus.
- PhotoBooth/App effects are isotopies of pixel coordinates
- The square torus is not isotopic to the hexagonal torus.

### Innumumarcy & the Fires of the Inquisition

### The Map

$$\begin{bmatrix}x' \\
y'\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 1 \\
1 & 2\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}x \\
y\end{bmatrix} \mod 1$$

**A point on the cat map is periodic if and only if its coordinates are rational.**

Let $A$ be the matrix above.  If a point $x$ is periodic, then there exist a positive integer $n$ such that 
$$A^n x - x \in \mathbb{Z}^2, \mbox{ i.e., } (A^n - I)x  = y \in \mathbb{Z}^2.$$  
Since $A$ has integer entries, the matrix $M = A^n - I$ does too.  Furthermore the determinant
$$\det(M) = \det(A^n - I) = \prod_{i=1}^2 (\lambda_i^n - 1)$$ where $\lambda_i$ are the eigenvalues of $A$.  The eigenvalues of $A$ are real and irrational, thus $\lambda_i^n - 1 \neq 0$ for all $n$, so $\det(M) \neq 0$.  

Since $M$ is an integer matrix with nonzero determinant, it is invertible over the rationals, so $x = M^{-1} y$  so $x$ is rational.

Conversely, if $x$ is rational, we can factor out the common denominator $d$ to get $x = \frac{1}{d} z$ for some $z \in \mathbb{Z}$. We want to show that there exist a positive integer $n$ such that $$A^n x - x \in \mathbb{Z}^2, \mbox{ i.e., } A^n x \equiv x  \mod 1. $$  

We'll use the pigeonhold principle.  

**Pigeons**: matrices $A^{n_i}$

**Pigeonholes**: matrices $A^{n_i}$ modulo $d$

Each entry of $A^{n_i}$ modulo $d$ gives $d$ possible values, so there are $d^4$ possible pigeonholes.  The entries of $A^{n_i}$ are (increasing) Fibonacci numbers so clearly there are more pigeons than pigeonholes, so by the pigeonhole principle there must be exist a pair of integers $n_i$ and $n_j$ such that $A^{n_i} \equiv A^{n_j} \mod d$.  

Since $A$ is invertible, we can multiply both sides by $A^{-n_j}$ to get $A^{n_i - n_j} \equiv I \mod d$.
